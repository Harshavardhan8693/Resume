Enhance Keywords:
Research job postings for the desired role and ensure matching terminology (e.g., "end-to-end testing" or "regression suite").
File Format:
Save and upload the resume in a Word document (.docx) format when applying online, as some ATS may not parse PDFs as effectively.
Summary Section:
Add more keywords and role-specific terms, e.g., "driving end-to-end software testing lifecycle."
Add Certifications:
Include certifications (e.g., ISTQB, Certified Agile Tester) if applicable to strengthen ATS rankings.
